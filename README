Overview

  The build environment is heavily dependent on the directory structure
    Variables are defined in the build.bat file but the structure is fixed
  Depends on UGII_ROOT_DIR variable set in the system or shell


Building the grip programs

  1) Open a command prompt
  2) CD to the make folder
  3) run the 'build.bat' program
    A series of command prompts will open as each application is compiled


The build environment

  The directories consist of:
     'compiled'
     'make'
     'source'

  Compiled directory will contain all the compiled grip programs after the build.bat is executed

  Make directory has the build.bat program that executes each applications build located in the source folder

  Source folder has a common folder for all utilities shared source
    In the source folder will contain a folder of each applications name (This will be the name of the grx file)
      Each of application folder will have the source and a build.txt file
      The build.txt file lists all the dependencies for application and the last line must be the main programs name


How it works

  When you execute the build.bat program it will list all the directories in the source folder
    If a file name called build.txt exists in the folder it will then compile and build each line the build.txt file
    During the compiling state it looks to see if the grip is a common source, then copies it to that folder to make it work for the grip program to link later on
      Since compiling takes a few seconds to complete and we can link until it's done we recursively loop until it is complete
    Cleanup the grs files in the application folder if it is a common source (so not to confuse where the master copy is)
    
    Linking the application with the NX gripbatch.bat program, using the last line in the build.txt file

    Moving the executable to the compiled directory. Since linking takes a few seconds we again recursively loop until the applicationName.grx exists and moves it to the compiled directory


Optional parameters

   When running the build.bat program it has one optional parameter CLEAN
      This will delete all the *.gri files in the all of the directories and quit
      Use this if you want to do a completely clean build.
      Since the program waits until a gri file is found before continuing, if a gri already exists it will link with the existing file
         Good to do when upgrading to a new version of NX or new common library
